## Testing Mission

If you don't know what value testing brings, it is very difficult to do good testing.

Definition:  
*Testing mission is the answer to **Why do we test ?***

The mission is also given by **people**.

### Why do we test ?

- To find important problems
- To assess quality
- Because we have to
  
All three may be interested in the same things:

- bugs
- enhancements
- performance
- reliability
- usability
- security
- standards
- regulations
- benefits
- ???

If you have a vague mission, like  
*test the product* - **use 'so' trick.**
  
    *test the product*  
    *so we can find important problems*  
    *so we can take well-informed decissions*  
    *so ...*
    *so ...*

Find out what's important:

- Talk to stakeholders
- Investigate relevant information sources:
  - Specifications
  - Quality objectives
  - Fears
  - Technologies
  - Bussines knowladge
  - Real customers
  - ..., see [37 Sources for Test Ideas](https://testingideas.wordpress.com/2015/09/08/37-source-for-test-ideas-from-the-test-eye/)

Recognize important problems

- by ivestigating examples:
  - Patches
  - Complaints
  - Bad reviews
  - Embarassments
  - Bugs

- by guidelines:
  - Quality objectives
  - Error catalogue
  - Checklists
  - Requirements
  - Case studies

## Contex Analisys

(Based on James Bach's HTSM)

How should the project environment effect the testing ?

- Other's testing
- Developer/Tester interaction
- Test environment
- Planning and deliverables

What should be tested ?

- Create models (James Bach's SFDIPOT)

Which quality characteristics matter ?

## Test Strategy

The strategy drives the testing, in order to reach the testing mission.

Definition:  
*Test strategy consists of guidelines and ideas that describe **what** should be tested, and **how**.*

It' more than test plan or test process.

It's written to communicate to (at least) two audiences:

- Stakeholders
- Testers
